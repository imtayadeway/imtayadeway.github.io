My name is Tim.

I'm a software engineer at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

I like to make music with pianos, guitars, woodwinds and electronics.

I am particularly fond of the duck-rabbit:

This is my blog.

It may or may not cover things about Ruby, Emacs, Git, Linux, tea,
space jazz and aspect ratio-induced anxiety.

It uses the [Simplex theme](https://bootswatch.com/simplex).

Though it's of little use to anyone else, I like to keep track of what I'm reading [here](/reading-list). And I keep track of what I'm watching [here](/film).

I can be found on [GitHub] or can be [emailed] if you're into that.

Thanks for stopping by!
