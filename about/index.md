My name is Tim.

I'm a software engineer at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

I like to make music with pianos, guitars, woodwinds and electronics.

I am particularly fond of the duck-rabbit:

This is my blog.

It may cover some of the following topics: Ruby, Emacs, Git, Linux,
tea, dyspraxia, space jazz and aspect ratio-induced anxiety.

It uses the [Simplex theme](https://bootswatch.com/simplex).

I can be found on [GitHub], [LinkedIn], or can be [emailed]

Thanks for stopping by!
