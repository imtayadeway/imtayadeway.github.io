My name is Tim.

I'm a software engineer at Red Hat working on the
[ManageIQ](http://manageiq.org) team.

I like to make music with pianos, guitars and electronics.

I am particularly fond of the duck-rabbit:

I can be found on [GitHub], [LinkedIn], or can be [emailed]

This is a blog.

It may cover some of the following topics: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Emacs,
Git, Linux, tea, dyspraxia, space jazz and aspect ratio-induced
anxiety.

It uses the [Simplex theme](https://bootswatch.com/simplex).

Thanks for stopping by!
