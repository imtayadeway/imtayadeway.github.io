a defense of
quarter of the length? no.
throbbing, undulating, pulsing
recoil and leap
there is no *point* and that is the point
not to get all freudian or anything
it contains multitudes, as walt whitman sez
the performance of reading
my alma mata
emma
the woman blurring the lines between actors and the parts they play
to what extend is the woman lucy?
i love her though she is flawed, because she is flawed
ideas percolate, bubble up, surface
whirlind dervish
a reflection of the modern world
polite but not quite repressed - avoiding the excesses of stream of consciousness writing
charming, lovely, sweet but flawed, because she is flawed
learning how the stories intertwine, and that she does not support the other narrative
fat phobia
