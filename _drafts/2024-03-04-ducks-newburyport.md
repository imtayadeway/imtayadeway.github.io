I remember distinctly the first time I held a Lucy Ellmann book, unboxing the slim volume in the basement of the bookstore in which I was working in 2003. Initially seduced by the suggestion of smut on its cartoonish cover, I knew that this was not entirely a serious work, and though the unusual stylistic conceit that was obvious from leafing through the first pages seemed to confirm this there was the suggestion of something more to it, a blend of the irreverant and existential. I had to have it, and that copy never made it to the shop floor. I was so enthused with it that I almost immediately sent my copy, via a somewhat dubious inter-branch transfer, to a bookseller friend across the country, and if my unreliable memory serves it was the start of a torrid love affair, that I only mention to illustrate the potency of Ellmann's writing. I got everything else I could find in print, eagerly awaited her next release, and then . . . nothing happened for a while. And so I was surprised discovering in 2022, isolated mid-pandemic, in an effort to reconnect with the reading habits of my younger self, that Ellmann had written a 1000 page stream of consciousness novel, endorsed by my *alma mater* (ah, Goldsmiths, still a reliable champion of so many things I hold dear), had got the attention of the Booker lot even, the panel for which I assume far too timid to promote such an outlandishly ambitious work into its coveted first prize.

Its length and narrative style intimidated me at first, but my fears were soon allayed once I made the commitment to start it. Though it has been widely praised, some I think unfair criticisms have been leveled at it.

a defense of
quarter of the length? no.
throbbing, undulating, pulsing
recoil and leap
like waves on the horizon, crashing
there is no *point* and that is the point
not to get all freudian or anything
there is something freudian about the need for a single point or for it to be over as quickly as possible
it contains multitudes, as walt whitman sez
the performance of reading
my alma mata
emma
semi autobiographical
the woman blurring the lines between actors and the parts they play
to what extend is the woman lucy?
i love her though she is flawed, because she is flawed
ideas percolate, bubble up, surface
whirlind dervish
a reflection of the modern world
polite but not quite repressed - avoiding the excesses of stream of consciousness writing
charming, lovely, sweet but flawed, because she is flawed
learning how the stories intertwine, and that she does not support the other narrative
fat phobia
the fact that i think i know more about this character than any other fictional character, that she has confided so much in me, more than some of the other people in the book, and i know so many things about her, she's revealed to me things that she may not even know about herself, and i love her dearly more than any other
