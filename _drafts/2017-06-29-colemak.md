Without much warning I recently decided to learn Colemak.

# What?


# Why?

This came as a bit of a surprise to me as I have always felt somewhat
opposed to learning a new keyboard layout. This may have stemmed from
my own frustration in the past in doubling on Clarinet and
Saxophone. Though the two are keyed similarly..... Though it is very
common for people to do this.

I guess I saw the drawbacks as a) the initial effort of learning, b)
the confusion of having to "double", c) the awkwardness of having to
pair with someone.

The supposed benefits of .... I never saw as a net gain. But I think
there was one other factor that has completely swung this for me that
has probably not been present at any other time that I've been
thinking about this. It is that I am incredibly bored. So bored that I
don't want to learn anything exciting like a new programming language,
or a new natural language, or how to ride a unicycle. I've been
craving the dull repetition that I've felt as a musician, a quiet
confidence that if I do this dance with my hands slowly and correctly
enough times, I'll program myself to perform a new trick. I've been
actually longing for the brain ache you get when you're trying to do
something different and your muscle memory won't quit.
