- when i started it was all rspec, factory girl

- what problem did factory girl try to solve?
  - the mystery guest test smell
  - some problems:
    - factory girl has become bloated and even includes features that undercut its original aim (traits)
    - the mystery guest test smell is an xunit antipattern. it's only addressed if you ascribe to the four-phase test pattern.
    - idiomatic rspec is not this - is in many ways adversarial to the four-phase test pattern, taken to the extreme (marcelo lol)
    - factories are slow

- proposal:
  - if factories make the most sense with xunit-style tests, why not use an xunit test framework?
  - don't use factory girl/bot - use rails fixtures. they are faster and no worse than your awful factory bot/rspec tests JUST KIDDING.
