When I started my first job I was programming in Ruby sans Rails, and
knew I had to get up to speed quickly. I purchased Russ Olsen's
*Eloquent Ruby* (2011) and read it front-to-back, though I struggled a
bit towards the end. I tried some things out, and then I read it
again. Then I played around some more. I learned the joys of
metaprogramming and then burnt my fingers. I went back and read it a
third time, now with the understanding that some of the things in the
back were dangerous.

# my success owes a lot to this book

Up until *Eloquent Ruby*, the resources I had used to learn all had
the same agenda: how to tell the computer to do stuff. In other words,
they would describe the *features* of things without spending too much
time on the *attitudes* toward them. And it is much harder to do the
latter.

The concept of *Eloquent Ruby* was a revelation to me at the time -
the idea that there were not just rules that make up a language, but
idioms too, attitudes that might change over time. I loved idea that I
could learn to speak Ruby not just adequately but like a native.

By this time I felt bold enough to call myself a Rubyist. I bought
another of Olsen's books on design patterns and read it cover to
cover, again, multiple times. I was ambitious and knew that "good"
programmers have experience and expertise working in different
programming paradigms, but still not sure in what direction I would
go. So I learned with great interest that Olsen was either working on,
or had declared an intention to write, a book about Clojure.

I had no idea at this point what Clojure was, but Russ had gained my
trust enough for me to want to read about his new book, whatever it
was about.

Of course I had no idea at the time that this book would be in the
pipeline for years. I understand; these things take time. But,
impatient as I was, I started learning about Clojure anyway. I have
now played with it for about 3 years, have pored through some books
that were good at what they set out to do (exhaustively survey the
features of the language), have built some things of a certain
size. Alas, not getting to code and think in my second language every
day, I have never felt that I really "got" Clojure, that I really knew
it under the skin in the same way that I knew Ruby. I could not
properly call myself a Clojurist.

So I was pretty excited when I learned that Russ' book was nearing
completion, and that its title is, perfectly, *Getting
Clojure*. When it came out in beta form, I did something I almost
never do - I bought the eBook (I like to do my reading away from the
computer).

And it has not disappointed. I am so happy that all the elements of
Olsen's style are present - his gentle humor, his writing with
compassion for the learner, knowing what to leave out, what to
illustrate and to explain deeper, even if you think you know it. There
are examples that are made up yet so much more compelling than most
(it's hard to find ones that solve real problems and that are
sufficiently complex). There are lots of details on *why* you might
want to use a particular thing, or more importantly, why you might not
want to, aka "staying out of trouble". And there are examples of real
Clojure in use, often pulled from the Clojure source itself, that not
only illustrate but give me the confidence to dive in myself.

It seems strangely ironic that *Getting Clojure* isn't the book I
wanted way back then, but is the book that I need now. It is not a
book for beginners, though I did enjoy going over the earlier
chapters, cementing knowledge along the way, forming a new narrative
that keeps the things I don't need to know at arms length, while
emphasising/giving me the tools to ... find out more.
