title: "Do the Right Thing"
---

I once knew a wise, old yogi. Before being a wise, old yogi he had
been a wise, middle-aged Jew. And in a previous occupation he had been
a Freudian psycho-analyst. I knew he was wise because of these things
and because he had a gray beard and a wry smile and would say some
interesting and funny things. And at other times he would smile and
nod and say nothing at all. I can't remember if he ever stroked his
beard.

One day he said to me, "Asoka," which was the name under which I was
going at the time. "Asoka," he said, "do you know what is the single
driving force of all our desires, motives and actions?" I thought
about this for some time. I had my own ideas but, knowing he was a
Freudian, suspected that the answer was going to be something about
the libido.

"You probably suspect that the answer is going to be something about
the libido," he said. "But it's not." I listened patiently. "It's the
need, to be right." I laughed. While I wasn't totally surprised to
have heard a different answer, this one for some reason blew me away,
but not straight away. I wasn't prepared. I had never thought about
human nature in those terms before. And years ahead I would continue
to analyze my interactions and recast my past experiences in these
terms, and things started to make more sense.

But was he right? Maybe, I don't know. That's not the point I'm trying
to make here. But I am interested in what humanity looks like when you
put it under this lens. It doesn't make us look any better. But it is
in some way more agreeable. Maybe because this kind of behavior is
often reduced simply to "assholes", and it kind of hurts me every time
I call someone or think of them as an asshole. Being an asshole is
also a harder problem to solve.

What I'm especially interested in right now is the fact that I don't
believe I've ever seen such a high concentration of people who are
utterly driven by the need to be right _all the time_ as in the tech
industry, and I want to talk about it. It'll also be unavoidably about
my own relationship to the tech industry, and my own need to be right.

Allegedly I come from a long line of know-alls. Unsurprisingly, it's a
behavior that was passed down the male side of my family. Of course, I
don't really believe this is a genetic disposition, and it's quite
easy to see how this might work: as a child I remember being praised
for being 'brainy', got positive feedback for being 'right', learned
to hide my ignorance of things so as never to appear wrong. I was,
after all, a boy and was expected to be good at Science and
Mathematics.

As long as I appeared to be right all the time I felt like I was
winning, but I was actually losing. I've had a whole lifetime missing
answers to questions I didn't ask. I became lazy, unconsciously
thinking that my smarts would allow me to coast through life. Wrong!

Please don't raise your child to think that. As I've come to realize
way too late in life, children who are praised for the level of effort
in which they apply themselves (as opposed to their cleverness, or
natural talent) will be more successful. (* see richard wiseman, 59
seconds, praise be!)

So I'm aware that I have a problem. Trying to combat it every day is
the way that I choose to deal with it.

What are the important ways that being right manifest itself
negatively in the workplace?

There is a story about Kurt Vonnegut, who, at one point toward the end
of his relationship with his wife, realized that in a crucial moment
he could say something incredibly funny (which he had a knack for
doing) and upon doing so end his marriage, or refrain from saying
anything and thereby save it. Which option do you think he took? Being
right has the same mechanics.

* The dog/god thing
* celebrating being wrong - amelia bedelia?
* being right stands in the way of development
* being wrong
* creates hostile discussions (PRs, etc..)
* mansplaining
* trying to be helpful
* pair programming avoidance
* the gender problem in tech
* "assholes"
* bit about vonnegut ... More important to be funny than to save his marriage?
* refactoring hypnosis vs kent beck's tradeoffs
