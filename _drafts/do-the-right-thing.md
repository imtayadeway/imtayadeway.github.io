title: "Do the Right Thing"
---

i once knew a wise old yogi. before that he had been a wise,
middle-aged jew. and in a previous occupation he had been a freudian
psycho-analyst. i knew because of these things that he was wise, and
because he had a gray beard and a wry smile and would say some
interesting and funny things. at other times he would smile and nod
and say nothing at all. i can't remember if he ever stroked his beard.

one day he said to me, "asoka," which was the name under which i was
going at the time. "asoka," he said, "do you know what is the single
force driving all our desires, motives and actions?" i thought about
this for some time. i had my own ideas but, knowing he was a freudian,
suspected that the answer was going to be something about the libido.

"you probably suspect that the answer is going to be something about
the libido," he said. "but it's not." i listened patiently. "it's the
need to be right." i laughed. while i wasn't totally surprised to have
heard a different answer, this one for some reason blew me away, but
not straight away. i wasn't prepared. i had never thought about human
nature in those terms before. and years ahead i would continue to
analyse my interactions and recast my past experiences in these terms,
and things started to make more sense.

was he right? maybe, i don't know. that's not the point i'm trying to
make here. but i am interested in what humanity looks like when you
put it under this lens. it doesn't make us look any better. but it is
in some way more agreeable. maybe because this kind of behavior is
often reduced simply to "assholes", and it kind of hurts me every time
i call someone or think of them as an asshole. being an asshole is
also a harder problem to solve.

what i'm especially interested in right now is the fact that i don't
believe i've ever seen such a high concentration of people who are
utterly driven by the need to be right _all the time_ as in the tech
industry, and i want to talk about it (others have written the
prevalence of assholism....something something). let's look at some of
the ways i think this has manifested.



* my own childhood, psychology positive reinforcement.

allegedly i come from a long line of know-alls. unsurprisingly, it's a
behavior that is passed down the male side (find a better/funnier way
of saying this). of course, i don't really believe this is a genetic
disposition, and it's quite easy to see how this might work: as a
child i remember being praised for being 'brainy', got positive
feedback for being 'right', learned to hide my ignorance of things so
as never to appear wrong. as long as i appeared to be right all the
time i was winning, but i was actually losing. i've had a whole
lifetime missing answers to questions i didn't ask. worse still, i
learned that if i could say something with some authority among people
who wouldn't know the difference, i could well be right and i'd appear
to be smarter than they thought i was. worst of all, i became lazy,
unconsiously thinking that my smarts would allow me to coast through
life. wrong! * see richard wiseman, 59 seconds, praise be!

* the dog/god thing
* being right stands in the way of development
* being wrong
* creates hostile discussions (PRs, etc..)
* mansplaining
* pair programming avoidance
* the gender problem in tech
* "assholes"
* bit about vonnegut ... more important to be funny than to save his marriage?
* refactoring hypnosis vs kent beck's tradeoffs
