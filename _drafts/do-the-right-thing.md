title: "Do the Right Thing"
---

I once knew a wise, old man. I knew he was a wise, old man because he
embodied certain stereotypes about wise old men. First, he was a gray-bearded
yogi. Before this he was a New York Jew and a practicing Freudian
psychoanalyst. He had a wry smile and would say some interesting and funny
things. And at other times he would smile and nod and say nothing at
all. I can't remember if he ever stroked his beard. And his name was
Ramya.

One day he said to me, "Asoka," (which was the name under which I was
going at the time). "Asoka," he said, "do you know what is the single
driving force behind all our desires, motives and actions?" I thought
about this for some time. I had my own ideas but, knowing he was a
Freudian, suspected that the answer was going to be something to do with
the libido.

"You probably suspect that the answer is going to be something to do
with the libido," he said. "But it's not." I listened patiently. "It's
the need â€¦ to be right." I laughed. While I wasn't totally surprised to
have heard a different answer, this one for some reason blew me away,
but not straight away. I wasn't prepared. I had never thought about
human nature in those terms before. And years ahead I would continue
to analyze my interactions and recast my past experiences in these
terms, and things started to make more sense.

I wouldn't expect anyone else to have the same reaction. I suspect
others would find this to be either obvious, banal, or plainly
wrong to them, and if this you, I don't intend to try to convince you
otherwise (there might be a certain irony in doing so). What I want to
do instead is to document what became for me a personal manifesto, and
a lens through which I began to look at the world.

I saw that a preoccupation with being right was essentially an
expression of power and that asserting rightness was about exerting
power over others. I also saw that this preoccupation was perhaps more
to do with the appearance of being right, and that missed
opportunities for learning would be the cost of maintaining it.

I was the principle subject of my examination, and it has become a
goal to continue to examine and dismantle the ways in which I assert
"rightness". But I also want to look at how groups of people can
create a culture of "rightness", the effects that has, and what we can
do to limit some of the more harmful effects.

Allegedly I come from a long line of *know-it-alls*. Unsurprisingly,
it's a behavior that passes down the male side of my family. Of
course, I don't really believe this is a genetic disposition, and it's
easy to see how this might work. As a child I remember my family's
praising me for being 'brainy'. They gave me positive feedback for
being 'right' and I learned to hide my ignorance of things so as never
to appear wrong.

As long as I appeared to be right all the time I felt like I was
winning, but I was actually losing. I've had a whole lifetime missing
answers to questions I didn't ask. I became lazy, unconsciously
thinking that my smarts would allow me to coast through life.

Once I was free of a culture that was concerned primarily with
measuring and rewarding rightness (you guessed it - School), I had a
hard time knowing how to fit in, and it would take many years of
adjustments before I felt any kind of success.

Please don't raise your child to think that. As I've come to realize
way too late in life, children who are praised for the level of effort
in which they apply themselves (as opposed to their cleverness, or
natural talent) will be more successful. (* see richard wiseman, 59
seconds, praise be!)

But things get more interesting when you examine rightness in
interactions of people. What I'm especially interested in right now is
the fact that I don't believe I've ever seen such a high concentration
of people who are utterly driven by the need to be right _all the
time_ as in the tech industry.

What are the important ways that being right manifest itself
negatively in the workplace?

* The dog/god thing
* celebrating being wrong - amelia bedelia?
* being right stands in the way of development
* being wrong
* creates hostile discussions (PRs, etc..)
* mansplaining
* trying to be helpful
* pair programming avoidance
* the gender problem in tech
* "assholes"
* bit about vonnegut ... More important to be funny than to save his marriage?
* refactoring hypnosis vs kent beck's tradeoffs
