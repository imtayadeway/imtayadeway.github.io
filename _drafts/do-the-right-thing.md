title: "Do the Right Thing"
---

Some years ago when I was living in an Ashram in rural Virginia, I met
a wise, old man. I knew he was a wise, old man because he embodied
certain stereotypes about wise old men. First, he was a Gray-Bearded
Yogi. Before this he was a New York Jew and a practicing Freudian
Psychoanalyst. Sometimes he had would say a lot of interesting and
funny things, and at other times he would smile and nod and say
nothing at all. I can't remember if he ever stroked his beard.

One day he said to me, "Asoka," (the name under which I was going at
the time). "Asoka," he said, "do you know what is the single driving
force behind all our desires, motives and actions?" I thought about
this for some time. I had my own ideas but, knowing he was a Freudian,
suspected that the answer was going to be something to do with the
libido.

"You probably suspect that the answer is going to be something to do
with the libido," he said. "But it's not." I listened patiently. "It's
the need â€¦ to be right." I laughed. While I wasn't totally surprised
not to have got the right answer, this particular one for some reason
blew me away. I wasn't prepared. I had never framed human nature in
those terms before.

I wouldn't expect anyone else to have the same reaction. I suspect
others would find this to be either obvious, banal, or plainly wrong
to them, and if this is you, I don't intend to try to convince you
otherwise (there might be a certain irony in doing so). What I want to
do instead is to document what became for me a personal manifesto, and
a lens through which I began to look at the world. As a lens, you are
free to pick it up, take a look through it, and ultimately discard it
if you wish. But I rather like it a lot.

What happened that day was really only the start of a long
process. Eventually I saw that a preoccupation with being right was
essentially an expression of power and that asserting rightness (what
I will sometimes call "rectifying") was about exerting power over
others. I also saw that this preoccupation had perhaps more to do with
the appearance of being right, and that the cost of maintaining it
would be in missing opportunities for learning. I also saw that, while
the rectification obsession was not a uniquely male problem, there
seemed to be a general movement of rightness from that direction, and
we would do well to examine that too.

I was the principle subject of my examination, and it has become a
goal to continue to examine and dismantle the ways in which I assert
"rightness" in the world.

Allegedly I come from a long line of *know-it-alls*. Unsurprisingly,
it's a behavior that passes down the male side of my family. Of
course, I don't really believe this is a genetic disposition, and it's
easy to see how this might work.

As a child I remember my family's praising me for being 'brainy'. They
gave me positive feedback for being right and I learned to hide my
ignorance of things so as never to appear wrong. As long as I appeared
to be right all the time I felt like I was winning, but I was actually
losing. I've spent most of my life missing answers to questions I
didn't ask. I became lazy, unconsciously thinking that my smarts would
allow me to coast through life.

Once I was done with School, and with it a culture principally
concerned with measuring and rewarding rightness, I had a hard time
knowing how to fit in or do well. It would take years of
adjustments before I felt any kind of success. Whenever something
became hard, I'd try something new, and I was always disappointed to
find that opportunities were not handed to me simply because I was
'smart'.

It came as a small comfort to learn that I was not alone - in fact it
is well understood now that children who are praised for hard work
will be more successful than those that are praised for correctness or
cleverness.

I still don't fully grasp the extent to which these experiences have
shaped my thinking and my behavior, but I have understood it well
enough to have turned things around somewhat, applied myself, and have
some awareness of my rectifying behavior, even if I can't always
anticipate it.

None of this can happen in isolation, however, and it is most
interesting when we examine cultures of rightness as groups of people.
What I'm especially interested in right now is the fact that I don't
believe I've ever seen such a high concentration of people who are
utterly driven by the need to be right _all the time_ as in the tech
industry.

Let's look at some of the different ways that being right has manifest
itself negatively in the workplace.

### On Leadership and Teamwork

There is a well-known meme about the experience of being a programmer
and it looks like this:

<img src="/assets/two-states.png" class="img-responsive" alt="The two states of every programmer">

While neither one of these are true, it is true that *everyone* is
much closer to the first state than the second. The problem with
separating out this duality is that the two abstract states all too
easily become concretized as individuals, creating a culture of 10x
developers and, well, everyone else.

In my personal experience I have felt a strong feeling of teamwork and
commeraderie when I'm working with people who all humbly admit they
don't *really* know what they're doing. Note the qualification there -
nobody is saying they are incompetent, just that there are distinct
limits to their knowledge and understanding. There is the sense that
we don't have all the answers, but we will nonetheless figure it out
together. It promotes a culture of learning, of strong teamwork and
kinship. When everyone makes themselves vulnerable in this way great
things can happen. The problem is that it only takes one asshole to
fuck all that up.

When a team loses its collective vulnerability as one person starts to
exert rightness (and therefore power) downwards onto it, all the
positive effects I've listed above are lost. When rightness is
rewarded people become competitive and sometimes downright
hostile. Ultimately it rewards the loudest individuals who can make
the most convincing semblance of rightness and stifles all other voices.

This is commonly what we call "leadership", and while I don't want to
suggest that leadership and teamwork are antagonistic to each other, I
do want to suggest that a certain style of leadership, one concerned
principally with correctness, is harmful to it. A good leader will
make decisions (sometimes bold) to move forward in some direction,
even if that turns out to be the wrong direction.

### On Productivity

A preoccupation with being right can have a directly negative effect
on productivity. One obvious way is what I will call refactoring
hypnosis - a state wherein the programmer forgets the original intent
of their refactoring efforts and continue to rework code into a more
"right" state, often with no benefit while risking breakages in the
case of legacy code.

Style is another area that is particularly prone to pointless
exertions of rightness. It is not unusual for developers to have a
preference for a certain style in whatever language they are using,
and it is interesting that while opposing styles can seem utterly
wrong to the developer it seems that this is the area in which there
are the fewest agreements over what is considered good style or
"right". In Ruby there have been attempts to unify divergent opinion
in the Ruby Style Guide but it has been known to go back and forth on
some of its specifics (or merely to state that there are competing
styles), and the fact that teams and organizations eventually grow
their own style guides (AirBnb, GitHub, thoughtbot, Seattle.rb) show
that perhaps the only thing we can agree on is that a codebase be
consistent. Where it lacks consistency there lie opportunities to
rectify, but this is almost always a bad idea. Important historical
details get obscured by trivial wankery.

Finally, being right stands in opposition to notions like agile and
TDD.

### On Culture

One sentiment that I've seen commonly expressed is the idea that no
one, even experienced a celebrated engineers, really knows what they
are doing. I think that there is both humor and truth in that but
that, while I believe the sentiment is well-intentioned, words are
important and can sometimes undermine what's being expressed
here. I've seen people I admire and look up to utter something of the
form, look, I wrote [some technology you've probably heard of], and I
still do [something stupid/dumb] - what an idiot! This doesn't
reassure me at all, all I think is, wow, if you have such a hostile
opinion of yourself, I can't imagine what you'd think of me.

What can we do instead? Perhaps instead of fostering a culture of
self-chastisement we can instead celebrate our wrongness. We know that
failure can sometimes come at great cost for others, but it's almost
always because of the systems we have in place that are
flawed. Personal failure really is a cause for celebration because it
is also a learning, and celebrating creates an opportunity to share
that learning with others while simultaneously promoting a learning
culture destygmatized of wrongness (???). (I once suggested to a
colleague that we add some ceremony to this by making weekly sharings
of wrongness ("Failure Fridays") but it never took off....)

* creates hostile discussions (PRs, etc..)

It is very telling to me that the standard introduction to any
mansplanation, _well, actually...._, is almost the ultimate expression
of declaring rightness, or rectifying. It is rectifying behavior. It
is appropriate that we have identified this behavior as an expression
of masculine insecurity whose compliment finds the male trying to
exert power through rectifying. More innocent mansplanations - without
contradicting a man may simply declare that he is right, believing
this bloviation to be helpful to the person whose ignorance is assumed
- still work in the same way.

* Not to say that being right is wrong, just the desire to be right
  that colors our judgement?
