title: "do the right thing"
---

i once knew a wise old yogi. before that he had been a wise, middle-aged jew. and in a previous occupation he had been a freudian psycho-analyst. i knew he was wise because he had a gray beard and a wry smile and would say some interesting and funny things. at other times he would smile and nod and say nothing at all.

one day he said to me, "asoka," which was the name under which i was going at the time. "asoka," he said, "do you know what is the single force driving behind all our desires, motives and actions?" i thought about this for some time. i had my own ideas but, knowing he was a freudian, suspected that the answer was going to be something about the libido.

"you probably suspect that the answer is going to be something about the libido," he said. "but it's not." i listened patiently. "it's the need to be right." i laughed. while i wasn't totally surprised to have heard a different answer, this one for some reason blew me away. i had never thought about human nature in those terms before. but years ahead i would continue to analyse my interactions and reframe my past experiences in these terms, and things started to make more sense.

was he right? maybe, i don't know. that's not the point i'm trying to go for here. but i am interested in what humanity looks like when you put it under this lense, and it's a version that's more palatable than most others to me.

what i'm especially interested in now is the fact that i don't believe i've ever seen such a high concentration of people who are utterly driven by the need to be right _all the time_ as in the tech industry. let's look at some of the ways i think this has manifested.

allegedly i come from a long line of know-alls. unsurprisingly, it's a behavior that is passed down the male side (find a better/funnier way of saying this). of course, i don't really believe this is a genetic disposition, and it's quite easy to see how this might work: as a child i remember being praised for being 'brainy', got positive feedback for being 'right', learned to hide my ignorance of things so as never to appear wrong. as long as i appeared to be right all the time i was winning, but i was actually losing. i've had a whole lifetime missing answers to questions i didn't ask. worse still, i learned that if i could say something with some authority among people who wouldn't know the difference, i could well be right and i'd appear to be smarter than they thought i was. worst of all, i became lazy, unconsiously thinking that my smarts would allow me to coast through life. wrong!
