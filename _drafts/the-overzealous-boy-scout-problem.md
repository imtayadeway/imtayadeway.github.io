Boy scout rule
- it is not essential to boy scouting that the boy scout's intentions are self evident
- no one will ever examine the site of some boy scouting to try to figure out their intentions retroactively

Broken windows analogy
- it does not follow that broken code windows lead to code crime
- i'm not convinced that inconsistent code == broken windows
- no studies have examined the socialogical impact of inconsistent windows (or eclectic?)

Leave no trace (of stylistic concerns)
