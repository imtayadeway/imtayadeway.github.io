title: Code, Class and Cleavage
---

* I learned to code on netbook that cost $xxx
  - It had a broken screen
  - Running Linux distributions that would break
  - I am still using it for my server ??? (won't throw things away -
    way I was brought up, post war economy)
  - I still don't own a computer that's suited for doing development -
    though I could afford one now I couldn't for years
* Mentoring in Santa Monica - people who would turn up for 1 week -
  all of them had Macs.
* Infrequently talked about when we mention unrepresented groups
* Not trying to make myself out as working class
* Code schools, tuition fees, loans, private education, socialism
* Where are we today?
** Don't assume that someone turning up has a Mac
** Don't even assume that they're running some version of linux
** How many people want to deal with VMs, learning a new OS before they've even got started?
** Of those people who do, how many can get real help doing that?
