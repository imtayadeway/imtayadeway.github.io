one of the first things i knew i had to do when i switched to emacs
was to have it use my favorite color theme, choco. choco was created
by blah for the TextMate editor and later adapted for gedit.

i feel guilty of putting too much emphasis on aesthetics, but i love
choco for a number of reasons:

* it is dark, and i will often look at it all day. anything lighter
  feels like staring at a lightbulb.
* i love chocolate.
* it makes me happy. never experienced that with any other theme.
* it reminds me, although most likely for no good reason, of playing
  games such as MC Kids as a child.

if anything adding the theme to emacs seemed like the perfect
introductory elisp project.

first: autoconvert. mixed results
next: building my own.  harder.
