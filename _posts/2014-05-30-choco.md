one of the first things i knew i had to do when i switched to emacs
was to have it use my favorite color theme, choco. choco was created
by [Ludvig Widman](http://www.ludw.se/blog/) for the TextMate editor
and later [adapted for gedit](https://github.com/gmate/gmate).

now, i feel guilty for possibly putting too much emphasis on
aesthetics, but i do love choco and it's for a number of reasons:

* it is dark, and i will often look at it all day. anything lighter
  feels like staring at a lightbulb.
* just looking at its combination of colors makes me intensely happy,
  and i've never experienced that with any other theme, and maybe
  anything in art or nature (okay, okay...)
* yes, i love chocolate.
* it reminds me of playing games such as MC Kids as a child:

if anything, adding the theme to emacs seemed like the perfect
introductory elisp project.

first, not really knowing where to start, i tried using a
[conversion tool](https://code.google.com/p/tm-to-emacs-theme/). this
was unfortunately a little breaky, but i'm grateful for what i gleaned
from that project.

next i decided to build one up from scratch. since i was mostly
concerned with how things looked in ruby-mode, i decided to go
straight to the source, and was delighted to find out that
[ruby-mode ships with ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/misc/ruby-mode.el).
alright! fortunately it wasn't hard to sift through all that code to
find the bits i needed, and surprisingly only a handful of definitions
needed to be made to get up and running.

the results are

contributions are always welcome.
