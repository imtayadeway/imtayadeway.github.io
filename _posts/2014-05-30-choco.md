One of the first things I knew I had to do when I switched to emacs
was to have it use my favorite color theme, choco. Choco was created
by [Ludvig Widman](http://www.ludw.se/blog/) for the TextMate editor
and later [adapted for gedit](https://github.com/gmate/gmate).

Now, I feel guilty for possibly putting too much emphasis on
aesthetics, but I do love choco and it's for a number of reasons:

* It is dark, and I will often look at it all day. anything lighter
  feels like staring at a lightbulb.
* Just looking at its combination of colors makes me intensely happy,
  and I've never experienced that with any other theme, and maybe
  anything in art or nature (okay, okay...)
* Yes, I love chocolate. which in turn makes me intensely happy
* It reminds me, for various reasons, of games from childhood, such as
  [super mario world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World),
  [super mario kart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Kart),
  and [m.c. kids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.C._Kids), which in
  turn makes me intensely happy

If anything, adding the theme to emacs seemed like the perfect
introductory elisp project. Among the more delightful things I learned
along the way was that
[ruby-mode ships with ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/misc/ruby-mode.el).
Alright!
