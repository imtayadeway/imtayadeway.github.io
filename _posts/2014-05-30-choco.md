one of the first things i knew i had to do when i switched to emacs
was to have it use my favorite color theme, choco. choco was created
by [Ludvig Widman](http://www.ludw.se/blog/) for the TextMate editor
and later [adapted for gedit](https://github.com/gmate/gmate).

now, i feel guilty for possibly putting too much emphasis on
aesthetics, but i do love choco and it's for a number of reasons:

* it is dark, and i will often look at it all day. anything lighter
  feels like staring at a lightbulb.
* just looking at its combination of colors makes me intensely happy,
  and i've never experienced that with any other theme, and maybe
  anything in art or nature (okay, okay...)
* yes, i love chocolate.
* it reminds me, for various reasons, of games from childhood, such as
  super mario world, mario kart, and m.c. kids:

if anything, adding the theme to emacs seemed like the perfect
introductory elisp project. among the more delightful things i learned
along the way was that
[ruby-mode ships with ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/misc/ruby-mode.el).
alright!
