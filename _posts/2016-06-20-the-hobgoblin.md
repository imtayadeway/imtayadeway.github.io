For the uninitiated, *The Moomins* is a series of books and a comic
strip by the wonderful Tove Jansson. These Moomins live in the
fictional and idyllic Moominvalley set somewhere in the forests of
Finland. It is a complex landscape rich in imagery, symbolism,
archetypes, and their world has been reimagined many times since
Jansson first wrote about it. One such of these was *Moomin*, a show
from the 90s that fused the best of this Finnish folklore with zaney
Japanese animation. And it is my favorite from childhood.

So enamored was I with this show that I continue to watch it
unironically to this day, and not just for the feeling of
nostalgia. Though it is full of action and occasionally disturbing
(the groke!), I nonetheless find it really calming to lose myself in
the otherwise zen-like serenity of Moominvalley for 20 minutes or so.

Adventure is of course central to every episode, and sure enough the
Moomins meet lots of interesting and occasionally magical creatures, and
one of these is [The Hobgoblin].

I didn't remember much about the Hobgoblin from childhood, but I was
struck watching it more recently with the following:

* He is a powerful magician.
* He collects Rubies.
* He is in search of the King's Ruby.
* He rides a puma through the sky.

I am so surprised the Ruby community has not picked up on this yet!
