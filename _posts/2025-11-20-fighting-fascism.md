After a recently failed attempt to organize a reading group with some colleagues around Clara Zetkin's [Fighting Fascism: How to Struggle and How to Win], I reflected that one of the things that made it difficult was that, though I owned a physical copy of the book, not everyone was into that.  Although it was commonly understood that the principle texts were in the public domain and hence available online, it was not abundantly clear what they were and where to find them. After doing a little research, I've decided to share them here in one place perhaps to aid future me and anyone else who might be trying to pull this off.

In order, the substance of the book consists of:

1. The [Introduction] by John Riddell
2. [The Struggle Against Fascism]
3. [Resolution on Fascism]

If you are looking for either of the appendix texts or the glossary I do not believe they are available freely online, so you will have to buy the book for those (and please do buy the book!). Happy reading!
