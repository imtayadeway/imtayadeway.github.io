when i was in college i relearned to play the piano. it's not that i
had forgotten or was rusty, or even played badly, but i was in some
sense *doing it all wrong*. the process of relearning was at times
deeply upsetting, and the rewards only became clear years after as i
continued to teach myself in the afterlife of my schooling.

here are some of those rewards:

* greatly reduced risk of injury
* freedom from discomfort and cramping
* penalty for not playing every day, or even extended periods, greatly reduced
* need to play hours of advanced technical studies in order to stay in
  top form greatly reduced
* greater sensitivity and range of expression

what's maybe surprising is how little any of this directly addresses
elements of musicality.

what's reassuring to me now is that it's clear someone was looking out
for my well-being. not injuring myself, i am finding, is increasingly
appearing at the top of my list of goals for just about any
endeavor. second would be to experience freedom and joy in my
movements. if you've ever suffered an RSI as a result of typing, i'm
going to urge you to do the same. you may even be interested in how i
synthesized the principles of touch typing,
[ergonomic keyboards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomic_keyboard),
the
[alexander technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique)
and emacs in the pursuit of those goals as a developer.

### the posture
* use a chair that allows you to sit up straight with good posture,
  and to sit at the desk so that the arms may hang down freely from
  the shoulders, the elbows at the side.
* when striking a key, avoid resting the wrists on the desk, or
  raising them too high. from the side, the top of the forearm down to
  the knuckle will describe almost a straight line, the underside
  curved, like a bridge.
* the hand is strong, relaxed and curved, as if formed around a ball.
* sit in such a way that allows your arms to hang down free from the
  shoulder and alternately to form this strong bridge-like position in the
  hands and arms and then completly relax.

### what i learned from touch typing
* when pressing shift, control or meta in combination with another
  key, avoid pressing both with the same hand. and by avoid i mean
  don't ever, ever do that.

### the keyboard
* if your keyboard does not have a shift, control and meta key on both
  sides, then it is defective by design.  get a better keyboard, or
  rebind the keys (i'm looking squarely at you, macbook)
* for greater ease in pressing the control key, use an ergonomic
  keyboard that allows you to use the palm of your hand. emacs pinkie be gone!
* use an ergonomic/split keyboard that allows your hands and arms to be
  square and roughly a shoulder's width apart.

### the alexander technique
* do not extend the fingers in order to press a key that lies outside
  of the home row. move the hand and arm to accomodate.
* you unavoidably need to create tension in order to perform a
  movement. learn to watch for the buildup of tension, and learn to
  release that tension after the execution of each movement.
* avoid extending the fingers, or having them move excessively. type
  from the shoulders. the greatest movement will begin in the upper
  body, the smallest movement will be performed by the fingers
  themselves. hardly move your fingers at all.
* the hand and arm is heavy enough to depress a key using gravity
  alone. you will gradually learn to type by transferring this weight
  from key to key in a fluid and effortless motion.
* practice, sitting down, by holding one arm by the wrist using the
  other hand at chest height, the elbow by the side. relax the arm
  completely by holding the complete weight in the supporting hand
  (even better - have someone else support you). remove the supporting
  hand and let the arm freefall into the lap. try to imagine this
  movement as you lift the arm and let it fall as you depress a
  key. at the moment of impact, a small amount of tension is needed to
  form your bridge in order to strike the key accurately. immediately
  after, this tension can be completely released, as when resting in
  the lap.
