when i was in college i relearned to play the piano. it's not that i
had forgotten or was rusty, or even played badly, but i was in some
sense *doing it all wrong*. the process of relearning was at times
deeply upsetting, and the rewards only became clear years after as i
continued to teach myself in the afterlife of my schooling.

of course, 'doing it wrong' may be a far more damning and opinionated
assessment than is really necessary. but here are some of the benefits:

* greatly reduced risk of injury
* freedom from muscular discomfort and cramping
* penalty for not playing every day, or even extended periods, greatly reduced
* need to play hours of advanced technical studies in order to stay in
  top form greatly reduced
* greater sensitivity and range of expression

what's maybe surprising is how little any of this specifically
addresses elements of musicality. what's reassuring to me now is that
it's clear someone was looking out for my well-being. not injuring
myself, i am finding, is increasingly appearing at the top of my list
of goals for just about any endeavor.

so from that perspective, i'd like to talk about how to type. which is
not to say that you're doing it wrong, though this post may be
opinionated. it's in the spirit of my not wanting you to injure
yourself, and to share some ideas if you find that you are.

more specifically, it's going to be about emacs,
[ergonomic keyboards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomic_keyboard),
and the
[alexander technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique).

* ergonomic keyboard first
* emacs, emacs pinkie
* learned to use the keyboard properly
* my typing style, chiclet keyboards
